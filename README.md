# spewc_library

This repository is my C library.  
It has not only functions implemented myself about that provided by C standard library but also functions I developed independently.  
A Makefile in this repository creates a static library named **libspewc**
## Index
- **ft_printf** implemented main feature of printf

- **get_next_line** that returns a string line from a discriptor file 

- **libspewc** includes the other functions

## Make static library

git clone https://github.com/spew11/spewc_library.git && \
  cd spewc_library && \
  make
```
